# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# metanics
-Hello everyone lets  start the project
-We will be using the following tools and technologies
 -react
 -javascript
 -tailwind
 - use framer motion library for animation
 

 To provide the late text effects I used motion.div 
 which is the part of framer motion library in which we can provide the animation to the div
  <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}   // Initial state
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}   // Final state after animation
      transition={{ duration: 1 }} // Define transition duration
    >

 this code snipet can clear your doubts.

--> Having a problem with the header and the glass effect on scroll

run these command on terminal before npm run dev
basically Install all dependecies

- npm install framer-motion
- npm install react-icons --save
